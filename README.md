# RS232 Data Logger

## How Serial Port Logger solves it

RS232 Data Logger is quite easy to use. It is a one-window application where you can choose the COM ports for monitoring, specify the file to save logged info to, and define serial port settings (baud rate, stop bits, number of bits to transmit, parity checking, and flow control types). All collected data is saved in a text file that you can later read and fully analyze all data you need. 

## Log serial port communication, view and analyze logged data

With [free serial port monitor](https://www.com-port-monitoring.com/) you can connect to real or virtual serial port and monitor the transmitted data. Specify the text document to save all intercepted data to for your analysis. RS232 Logger will display how many bytes are stored in the log file and all data logged from the serial port in a comprehensive way.

## Test serial communication

RS232 Data Logger is a handy tool for testing serial port communication. As all data is saved into the log file, it can be analyzed later for any errors in commands or data. RS232 Data Logger can capture data streams of up to 256 COM ports.
